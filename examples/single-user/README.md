# Single-User Example

Minimal configuration for a solo developer or quick demo.

## When to Use

- Quick proof-of-concept
- Solo developer simulation
- Testing tool setup before scaling

## Setup

1. Set your PAT:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   $env:ADO_PAT = "your-token"
   # Linux/macOS
   export ADO_PAT="your-token"
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --config examples/single-user/seed.config.json --run-id demo-1
   ```

## Configuration Notes

- Single user scenario: the same user acts as creator and reviewer
- Reviewers are technically assigned, but excluded from voting (creator = reviewer)
- Comments are still generated by the same user

For PAT setup and env-var flexibility, see **[Configuration Reference](../../docs/configuration.md)**.
